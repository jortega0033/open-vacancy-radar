/**
 * Where SessionManager keeps `AgentSession` records — deliberately synchronous, since the only
 * implementation (`MemorySessionStore`) is. A future persistent store (e.g. SQLite) would likely
 * need this interface, and every call site in SessionManager, to become async; that's a real,
 * larger change intentionally left for when it's actually needed rather than half-implemented
 * (an untested `Promise<void>` union here today would just be a place for a future store to
 * silently break the current synchronous call sites).
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: only the `AgentSession` record. A session's live process handle
 * (an `AsyncGenerator` plus a `cancel()` closure) isn't something you can "store" at all, and its
 * buffered event history is kept as separate runtime-only state in SessionManager — see
 * docs/daemon.md#session-lifecycle-sessionmanager-sessionstore for why persisting replayable event history isn't part of
 * what this interface owns.
