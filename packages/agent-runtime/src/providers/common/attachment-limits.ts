/**
 * Single source of truth for the outbound-attachment byte bound (port of agentdock#152/#153),
 * shared by every layer that enforces it: the daemon routes (`routes/sessions.ts`,
 * `routes/v2-sessions-create.ts`, before a provider process ever spawns) and Claude's own
 * stdin-payload builder (which reads and base64-encodes the file). Both enforce it independently
 * -- belt and suspenders, not one substituting for the other -- but importing the same constant
 * means they can never silently drift apart the way two hand-copied literals could. A CV or
 * similar document is a handful of pages; this is generous for any real one.
