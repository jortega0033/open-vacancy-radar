# Electron

`apps/desktop` is a demo Electron + React client for the daemon. It exists to prove the daemon and
`@agent-dock/client` work end to end and to give you a real, working example to fork — it has no
provider-specific logic of its own.

## The three-layer boundary

```
Renderer (React)  ──IPC (contextBridge)──▶  Electron main  ──@agent-dock/client──▶  Daemon
```

The renderer **never** calls the daemon's HTTP+SSE API directly — only the main process does,
through one `AgentDockClient` instance. This isn't a style preference: a renderer `fetch()` to the
daemon cannot actually succeed, because the daemon deliberately never answers a CORS preflight. See
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#renderer-never-talks-to-the-daemon-directly) for the full explanation
of why, including what was reproduced against a real browser tab. The short version for this doc:
keep new daemon calls in `electron/main.ts`, never add a `fetch()` to the daemon from anywhere
under `src/` (the renderer).

## BrowserWindow security settings

`electron/main.ts` creates its window with:

```ts
webPreferences: {
  contextIsolation: true,
  nodeIntegration: false,
  sandbox: true,
  preload: join(__dirname, 'preload.js'),
}
```

`webSecurity` is never overridden. `setWindowOpenHandler` denies every `window.open`/`target=_blank`
popup and opens the URL in the OS browser instead. `will-navigate` (`isAllowedNavigationTarget()`
in `main.ts`) allows only: in dev mode, the exact dev-server *origin* (a real `new URL(...).origin`
comparison, not a `startsWith` prefix match — the earlier prefix check would have let
`http://localhost:5173.evil.example` through against an allowed `http://localhost:5173`); in
packaged mode, the exact `file://` URL of the app's own `dist/index.html`, not any local file path.
Anything else redirects to the OS browser instead. A `session.setPermissionRequestHandler` denies
every permission request by default (camera, mic, geolocation, notifications, ...). None of this
matters for the *current* UI (it renders no untrusted content or links, and requests no
permissions), but it's cheap defense in depth for a fork that later adds either — see
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#electron-hardening).

## The preload bridge

`electron/preload.ts` exposes exactly seven functions on `window.agentDock` via `contextBridge` —
never a generic "invoke this channel with this payload" tunnel, and never the daemon's base URL or
bearer token. `getDaemonStatus`/`onDaemonStatus` specifically reconstruct a clean status object
from the IPC payload rather than passing it through once its shape looks roughly right, so an
accidental extra field on the main-process side (a token, a base URL) can never ride along even by
mistake — see `apps/desktop/test/preload.test.ts` for the regression test against this real module:

```ts
interface AgentDockBridge {
  getDaemonStatus(): Promise<DaemonStatus>;
  onDaemonStatus(callback: (status: DaemonStatus) => void): () => void;
  listProviders(): Promise<ProviderStatus[]>;
  createSession(input: CreateSessionInput): Promise<AgentSession>;
  cancelSession(sessionId: string): Promise<void>;
  onSessionEvent(callback: (sessionId: string, event: AgentEvent) => void): () => void;
  selectDirectory(): Promise<string | null>;
}
```

Each maps to one `ipcMain.handle(...)` in `main.ts`. If you're adding a new capability the renderer
needs, add a narrow, single-purpose function here — resist the temptation to add a generic
"send arbitrary IPC channel + payload" escape hatch, since that's exactly the shape that would let a
compromised renderer reach something it shouldn't.

## Daemon lifecycle from Electron's side

On `app.whenReady()`, `main.ts` spawns the daemon as a child process
(`spawn(process.execPath, args, { env: { ...process.env, ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE: '1' }, ... })`),
using `resolveDaemonEntry()` (`electron/resolve-daemon-entry.ts`) to pick the right entry point for
dev/packaged/unpacked — see [packaging.md](packaging.md#resolvedaemonentry) for the three cases. It
then polls the discovery file (`waitForDaemonReady`, 200ms interval, 15s timeout) until it can read
a port+token and successfully call `client.health()`, which doubles as both the readiness check and
the protocol-compatibility check in one call. `daemon:status` IPC events (`connecting` / `ready` /
`unavailable`) let the renderer show its own connection state without ever seeing *why* in terms of
daemon internals.

`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` means a second launch of the app focuses the existing window
instead of opening a second one — which would otherwise spawn a second daemon and lose the
single-instance race described in [daemon.md#single-instance-behavior](daemon.md#single-instance-behavior).

On quit, `killDaemon()` aborts the active SSE subscription, best-effort calls
`POST /sessions/cancel-all` over HTTP to cancel *every* in-flight session (not just the one the UI
happens to be tracking), then kills the daemon child process. This exists specifically because
Windows' `child.kill()` doesn't deliver a real `SIGTERM` the daemon's own shutdown handler could
otherwise catch — see [daemon.md#shutdown](daemon.md#shutdown) for the full explanation.

## Renderer trust assumptions

The renderer is treated as **semi-trusted, not adversarial** — it's this repo's own React code,
sandboxed by Electron's process isolation, but it's still the layer closest to whatever the CLI's
output ends up rendering. Concretely: the renderer never receives the daemon's token or base URL
(so even a fully compromised renderer can't reach the daemon directly), and every IPC input from
the renderer is re-validated against the Zod schemas at the `ipcMain.handle` boundary in `main.ts`
— not just trusted because it came from "our own" preload bridge. See the comment on
`daemon:create-session` in `electron/main.ts` for why that revalidation is a distinct concern from
`@agent-dock/client`'s own validation of the daemon's response.

## The working-directory picker

`selectDirectory()` opens a native OS directory picker (`dialog.showOpenDialog`) from the main
process and returns the chosen path (or `null` if cancelled) to the renderer — this is the only way
a session's `cwd` gets set; the renderer cannot read the filesystem itself to construct one.

## Provider and session flow (what the demo UI actually does)

1. On load, the renderer calls `listProviders()` and shows each provider's `installed` /
   `authenticated` state (routing the user to the CLI's own login flow if `installed` is true but
   `authenticated` isn't).
2. The user picks a provider, a working directory (via the picker above), and types a prompt.
3. `createSession(input)` creates the session; `main.ts` immediately starts forwarding that
   session's SSE events to the renderer via `onSessionEvent`.
4. `EventLog.tsx` renders each `AgentEvent` with a single `switch (event.type)` — see
   [protocol-v1.md](protocol-v1.md) for the full event union; the UI never branches on which
   provider produced an event.
5. `cancelSession(id)` is available while a session is running.

## Where to safely add native functionality

- **A new daemon capability the UI needs**: add the IPC handler in `main.ts`, the typed function in
  `preload.ts`'s `AgentDockBridge`, and call it from the renderer through `window.agentDock`. Don't
  add a daemon call directly in renderer code.
- **A new native OS integration** (file picker, notifications, tray icon, etc.): same pattern — main
  process owns the Electron/Node API, preload exposes a narrow typed function, renderer calls it.
  Never enable `nodeIntegration` or disable `contextIsolation`/`sandbox` to shortcut this.
- **Rendering content that isn't this repo's own UI** (e.g. a tool result containing a link or
  HTML): route external links through `shell.openExternal` (already the default for any navigation
  away from the app, see [BrowserWindow security settings](#browserwindow-security-settings) above)
  rather than loading them in-window.

## Build tooling

`vite-plugin-electron/simple` (`vite.config.ts`) bundles `electron/main.ts` and `electron/preload.ts`
with esbuild and drives the Electron process during `vite dev` (launch + reload on change); `vite
build` produces the same `dist-electron/` output for packaging. `preload.js` is forced to CommonJS
output (`format: 'cjs'`) since Electron's sandboxed preload loader doesn't support ESM, even though
the rest of this project is `"type": "module"`.
