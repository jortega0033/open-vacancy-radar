# Packaging

`apps/desktop/electron-builder.yml` configures [electron-builder](https://www.electron.build/) to
produce a distributable desktop app. Today that means a Windows NSIS installer — see
[Platform matrix](#platform-matrix) below for what's actually been verified versus what's merely
not-yet-attempted.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm build         # compiles every package — the prerequisite for packaging, not packaging itself
pnpm package:win   # pnpm build, then electron-builder --win nsis
pnpm package       # pnpm build, then electron-builder for whatever platform you're on
```

Both `package` commands are non-interactive and safe to run from a clean checkout after `pnpm
install`, with no code signing configured — there's nothing to sign with in this repository (see
[Unsigned installer](#unsigned-installer-and-smartscreen) below).

## What `pnpm build` produces (the prerequisite step)

- `packages/shared/dist/`, `packages/agent-runtime/dist/` — compiled library output (plain `tsc`)
- `apps/daemon/dist/index.js` — the daemon bundled by **esbuild** into one self-contained file,
  every dependency inlined (including the two packages above and `fastify`/`zod`) — required so it
  can run under plain `node`, with no workspace resolution or `tsx`, once packaged. `tsc` alone
  can't produce this: `packages/shared` and `packages/agent-runtime` intentionally publish
  TypeScript source (their `package.json` `main` points at `src/index.ts`, not a built `dist/`) so
  `tsx`/Vite/Vitest get live source with no separate build step in dev — but that means a plain
  `node dist/index.js` with no loader can't resolve them through a bare package specifier. This
  was an actual bug, not a theoretical risk: caught by running the packaged-mode code path
  (`node dist/index.js`) and hitting `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND` — see
  `apps/daemon/scripts/build.mjs` for the fix.
- `apps/desktop/dist/` — the Vite production build of the React renderer
- `apps/desktop/dist-electron/main.js`, `preload.js` — the Electron main process and preload
  script, each bundled to a single file (`main.js` inlines `@agent-dock/client`,
  `@agent-dock/shared`, and `zod`; `preload.js` is forced to CommonJS since Electron's sandboxed
  preload loader doesn't support ESM)

None of this is an installer yet — `electron .` against `apps/desktop` at this point runs the app
unpacked, useful for a quick check without a full package step.

## Output layout

```
dist-packages/
  win-unpacked/                       the unpacked app (AgentDock.exe + resources/)
  AgentDock-Setup-<version>.exe       the NSIS installer
```

`directories.output: ../../dist-packages` in `electron-builder.yml` deliberately keeps installer
output at the repo root, out of both `apps/desktop/dist/` (Vite) and `dist-electron/` (esbuild via
vite-plugin-electron) — installer output never mixes with plain build artifacts. `dist-packages/` is
gitignored.

## Runtime layout once packaged

```
AgentDock.exe                    (Electron; renderer + main process live in resources/app.asar)
resources/
  app.asar                       renderer (dist/) + main + preload — no node_modules needed,
                                  everything is bundled at build time (see above)
  daemon/
    index.js                     the daemon's own esbuild bundle, unmodified from apps/daemon/dist/
```

## The daemon ships outside `app.asar`

`extraResources: [{ from: ../daemon/dist, to: daemon }]` in `electron-builder.yml` puts the daemon
bundle *outside* the asar archive entirely, rather than relying on Electron's asar-aware `fs`
patching. It's spawned as a separate OS process (`child_process.spawn`) rather than imported code
— asar is a virtual filesystem Electron's own `fs` module knows how to read, but handing a path
inside it to a freshly spawned process is exactly the kind of "happens to work by accident"
behavior this project avoids.

## `resolveDaemonEntry()`

`apps/desktop/electron/resolve-daemon-entry.ts` is a pure function (no Electron import, fully
unit-testable — see `apps/desktop/test/resolve-daemon-entry.test.ts`) with three cases, in priority
order:

1. **Dev server** (`VITE_DEV_SERVER_URL` set): always run `apps/daemon/src/index.ts` live through
   `tsx`, even if a stale `dist/` build exists from an earlier `pnpm build`.
2. **Packaged** (`app.isPackaged`): `process.resourcesPath/daemon/index.js` — never source, never
   `tsx`, since neither exists in a packaged build.
3. **Unpacked production build** (`pnpm build` ran but the app isn't packaged, e.g. `electron .`
   directly): prefer the daemon's own `dist/index.js` next to its source; fall back to `tsx` +
   source only if that build hasn't been run yet.

Tests assert packaged mode never falls through to the `tsx`/source path, since neither exists in a
real packaged build — that fallback silently working in dev but silently failing once packaged is
exactly the class of bug this function's test coverage exists to catch.

## What electron-builder treats as a runtime dependency

`react`, `react-dom`, `zod`, and `@agent-dock/shared`/`@agent-dock/client` are all fully inlined
into `dist/` and `dist-electron/main.js` at build time (Vite for the renderer, esbuild via
vite-plugin-electron for main) — none of them are read from `node_modules` once built. They live in
`package.json`'s `devDependencies`, not `dependencies`, specifically so electron-builder's automatic
production-dependency resolution (which inspects `dependencies` and copies the matching
`node_modules` trees into the package independently of the `files` config) doesn't embed a second,
unused, unbundled copy of each. This was caught by unpacking a real built `app.asar` and finding
`node_modules/@agent-dock/shared` inside it despite an explicit `files` list that excluded
`node_modules` entirely.

## Start Menu and single-instance behavior

The NSIS config (`nsis:` in `electron-builder.yml`) creates a Start Menu shortcut
(`createStartMenuShortcut: true`) but no desktop shortcut by default, and allows the user to change
the install directory (`allowToChangeInstallationDirectory: true`). The installed app takes
`app.requestSingleInstanceLock()` — launching it a second time (Start Menu, desktop, or otherwise)
focuses the existing window rather than opening a second one, which would otherwise spawn a second
daemon and lose the race described in
[daemon.md#single-instance-behavior](daemon.md#single-instance-behavior). This was verified live
against a real installed build: launching the packaged `.exe` a second time while the first was
running left the process count and the daemon's port unchanged.

## Unsigned installer and SmartScreen

The NSIS installer and the packaged `AgentDock.exe` are unsigned — electron-builder's log shows
signing steps being skipped for lack of a certificate. **Expect Windows SmartScreen to warn on
first run** ("Windows protected your PC" / unknown publisher) — that's expected behavior for an
unsigned OSS boilerplate build, not a packaging bug. Code signing was explicitly out of scope for
this milestone; see [troubleshooting.md](troubleshooting.md) if you need to click through it for
local testing.

## Platform matrix

| | source / dev | production build | packaged app | installer | uninstall |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Windows** | verified | verified | verified (installed, launched, closed, relaunched, second-instance-blocked) | verified (NSIS, silent install/uninstall) | verified |
| **macOS** | untested | untested | untested | not implemented | — |
| **Linux** | untested | untested | untested | not implemented | — |

Nothing in the code is deliberately Windows-only — path handling uses `node:path` throughout, and
process management already has explicit POSIX branches (see
[SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md#process-hygiene)) — but "should work" and "verified" are different
claims; only Windows has actually been installed and exercised end to end. Adding `mac`/`linux`
targets (`dmg`/`zip`, `AppImage`/`deb`) to `electron-builder.yml` is a reasonable next step but
wasn't attempted here — macOS/Linux packaging are explicitly out of scope for this milestone, same
as signing/notarization.

## Verifying a packaging-sensitive change

If you touched anything under `apps/desktop/electron/` (main process, preload, or
`electron-builder.yml`), `pnpm build` and `pnpm typecheck` alone won't catch every packaging-mode
failure mode — the three real bugs documented above (`resolveDaemonEntry`'s asar boundary, the
`devDependencies`-vs-`dependencies` duplication, and the shutdown-path crash in
[architecture.md](architecture.md)) were each only caught by actually running `pnpm package:win` and
launching the result. Run it and confirm the app launches from
`dist-packages/win-unpacked/AgentDock.exe` before considering the change done.
